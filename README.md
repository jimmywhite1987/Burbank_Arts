# `Burbank Arts Project`

## Project Description

-  The goal of this project is to develop an Adobe Illustrator file that geographically represents the given datasets.
- There are two main map styles that have been developed. The first is a close up map of Sonoma County, which has color-coded points to represent the specific geographic locations of the different education programs within the Luther Burbank Center for the Arts organization.
- The second style includes a map of the USA, the state of California, and select countries where programs are based and uses hatches to show what programs are present in each location.
- There are also several countries around the world that are represented in the final product.
- Using Python and Jupyter Lab as a jumping off point, the datasets were cleaned and divided by program and then used to create a prototype of the final map in Illustrator. For the Sonoma County map, a vector 'eps' file was exported directly into Illustrator so that the points on the final product map maintained accuracy.
